# open cmd to install packages

pip install playsound==1.2.2 (this is vv important para basahin niya yung -audio.mp3)
pip install speechrecognition

# installing pyaudio:
#
so need mag-download muna ng pyaudio wheel file (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) in my case, PyAudio-0.2.11-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl worked for me. So if nag-error sa inyo, try to download other versions.
#
after downloading, lagay niyo sa folder same with this MAIN.PY and then type niyo sa cmd yung location ng wheel file. In my case, it's 'dir Downloads' and then 'dir vitual assistant' and then 'pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl' there should be no other errors here. After this, you're good to go.

# other ideas what to put in chap 4-5
  record the delay of response or time of response, 
  estimated power usage everyday, every month or annually, 
  how many questions can SAB accomodate, 
  how many ppl can SAB accomodate, 
  how many languages can SAB use, 
  chap 4 ilalagay kung saan siya ilalagay. In our case, we agreed to placing SAB in the registrar's office.
