
DOCUMENTATION OF ERRORS AND HOW TO FIX THEM:

'2022-11-06 18:11:32.702238: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'cudart64_110.dll'; dlerror: cudart64_110.dll not found
2022-11-06 18:11:32.728766: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cudart_stub.cc:29] Ignore above cudart dlerror if you do not have a GPU set up on your machine.'
-they say these warnings can be ignored by adding:
    import os
    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
    (but this didn't fix my problem)

-or download the mssing file (CUDNN64_8.DLL) here:
https://www.dll-files.com/cudnn64_8.dll.html and put in your bin directory.
Example, 'C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.3\bin.'
(they say it fixes the problem)

-but you can also ignore them since this means that your comp doesn't use NVIDIA as its GPU. the code still works after all.

'curses is not supported' - do 'pip install windows-curses'

'Scipy not supported!' - do 'pip install scipy'

'WARNING:tensorflow:From C:\Users\trish\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\compat\v2_compat.py:107: disable_resource_variables (from tensorflow.python.ops.variable_scope) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
non-resource variables are not supported in the long term'
-you can ignore this since its only a warning but if you want to remove
this completely you can mention 'use_resource= False' in 'tf.get_variable()' which will
be forced to true when eager execution is enabled by default in Tensorflow 2.x.
(honestly, I don't know what they mean pero mukhang di ko pa naman kailangang intindihin XD)


if you added new patterns/responses in intents.json, please remove the old versions of the files: 
checkpoint, data.pickle, model.tflearn.data, model.tflearn.index, model.tflearn.meta 
afterwards, re-run the program again so that the bot can learn the new data.


'Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, 
or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases.'

-stack overflow solved this differently but what I did here to 
fix this was to use 'python' in this line of code:

def e_gui():
    os.system('python admin\\admin_gui_eng.py')

instead of 'python3' which I used first.
